# QR-Encryption-and-Decryption
The system generally uses symmetric key encryption, where the same key is used for both encryption and decryption. This approach is efficient and suitable for QR-based applications, as it allows fast processing and minimal data size. A simple user interface can be included to allow users to enter text, generate an encrypted QR code.
